		<h3>REASONS JOHN DENVER IS AN ALIEN</h3>
		<pre >
He was born very near the time of the roswell new mexico crash 
	He was born IN roswell new mexico
	
John denver’s father worked in the air force 
	What he actually did in the military is classified 
	We know he “taught” john denver to fly an airplane 
	
He cites his parents in an acceptance speech, saying they are the “biggest country western music fans in the world”- he could have taken up country music to please his “parents” or perhaps to please his actual parents on his home planet
	This would make sense because many of his songs are about space (particularly the andromeda galaxy), flight, and leaving the earth
		The ones that aren’t about those things typically feature the nature of earth- who better than an alien to be fascinated by the flora and fauna of earth
		
He was obsessed with space and space exploration
	He took the NASA astronaut test- and passed, meaning he could have become one of the first citizens in space
		He nearly ended up on the challenger aircraft because of that
			He would have died- which raises the question of whether the challenger crash was planned and what john denver had left to do on earth
				One of the individuals on the challenger when it crashed shared with a friend that while serving in the air force he was shown images of the aliens found in roswell during the crash

His activist interest could have come from a mission to improve humanity while he was on earth

He died in a mysterious solo plane crash
	Several “accidents” had to happen in order for his death to occur 
		The particular plane he was in was experimental and had a weird manual fuel switch that pretty much always sent the plane in question into a dive 
		He didn’t refuel the plane before takeoff, something he was known for doing (and something most experienced pilots like himself are accustomed to doing)
	Several parts of “his” body were never found and his body was initially unidentifiable
	
In 2017 the government worked with the movie industry to feature “country roads take me home” in as many movies as possible, particularly the sequel to “alien”-- so googling “john denver alien” returned only results on the movie soundtrack
